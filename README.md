# Notes Migration → Obsidian (AI-First)

This repository is a **starter shell** for migrating my existing notes, links, and attachments from **OneNote** and **Notion** into **Obsidian**, with the long-term goal of making my knowledge base **AI-iterable, portable, and tool-independent**.

This is not a finished product — it is a **working space**.

---

## Why This Repo Exists

I have accumulated notes across:
- OneNote
- Notion
- External links
- PDFs and images

This project exists to:
- Move everything into **Markdown**
- Make **Obsidian** the single source of truth
- Structure notes so they can be easily processed by **AI tools**
- Avoid vendor lock-in
- Build a long-lasting personal knowledge system

---

## What I Will Do Here (Eventually)

- Export notes from OneNote and Notion
- Convert them into clean Markdown
- Preserve links, context, and attachments
- Add basic metadata (YAML frontmatter)
- Organize notes inside an Obsidian vault
- Iterate, refine, and connect notes using AI

---

## What This Is *Not* (Yet)

- No automation scripts (for now)
- No finalized folder structure
- No strict conventions
- No promise of speed

Clarity first. Automation later.

---

## Obsidian as the Destination

Obsidian is used because it:
- Stores notes as plain Markdown
- Works offline and locally
- Supports backlinks and graph thinking
- Plays well with AI tools and CLIs

This repo will evolve **with** the vault structure, not ahead of it.

---

## AI-Assisted Development

This project will be built using **pair programming and thinking** with AI tools such as:
- ChatGPT
- Gemini
- Claude

AI will be used for:
- Planning workflows
- Writing and refining scripts
- Cleaning and restructuring notes
- Generating summaries, tags, and links
- Exploring better knowledge structures

AI is a collaborator, not the owner of the knowledge.

## Current Status

🟡 **Initialization phase**

This README is the reminder:
- Why I started
- What not to rush
- Where to begin when I return

## Guiding Principle

> Notes should survive tools.  
> Structure should evolve naturally.  
> AI should amplify thinking, not replace it.
